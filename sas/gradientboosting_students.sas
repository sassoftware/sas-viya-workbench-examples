 EXAMPLE:     gradientboosting_students.sas
 DATA:        students_train, students_test
 DESCRIPTION: This data set contains student enrollment information. The goal
              is to analyze what factors could impact a student's drop out
              rate.
 PURPOSE:     This example shows how to build a classification tree model using
              the GRADBOOST procedure without the need to use a separate
              cloud-based server. It also demonstrates the use of analytic
              stores as a mechanism for saving models and scoring them.

 The example showed how we can perform SAS速 Viya速 analytic processes without a
 separate cloud-based server. It also demonstrated the use of saving analytic
 stores into files that can be used by any other product that supports them.
 As a result, a user can use SAS速 Viya速 Workbench to quickly try out ideas by
 building and testing models, which can then be saved for use in other
 environments as needed.
